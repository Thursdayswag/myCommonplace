What is freedom? Is freedom a feeling? Could freedom be a way of living? Is freedom something I can feel? What if I have no idea what freedom is? I love knowing I have the freedom to manifest absolutely anything into my experience. Is freedom a solid thing that I can attain and own for myself? Freedom is abstract, isn't it? Can one HAVE freedom? What does it mean to have anything? I've had a cold before. I've experienced "cold" symptoms temporarily. The effects of the cold. Is having freedom the same as being free? Is having the cold the same as being sick? So, what is freedom? When I think of the word freedom, it feels like a breath of fresh air. Like pure elation, love, passion, expansion. I've felt this feeling before.
