- I like the Chimera. I like its form, its composition, and its clean details
- Wow. I love the color of the drawn shapes on the Etruscan Cista. I love the skinniness of the drawn lines.
- Voltive statue: I feel good while viewing this piece. I enjoy its rhythm and its biometric form. Eye-shaped shadows can be observed on the legs. The boobs and the groin dominate the sculpture.
