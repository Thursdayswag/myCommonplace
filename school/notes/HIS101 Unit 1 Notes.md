+**EGYPT! FIRST UNIT**+
- "Egypt is the best example of an ancient river valley."
- Egypt: "gift of the Nile"
- 10,000BCE: 
	- melting of ice cap in the north dried up Africa. People receeded to the Nile river. 
	- climate change. Europe became much more habitable, North Africa became much less inhabitable
- The Nile river is the world's largest river. 550 miles of the Nile goes through Egypt. 
- The Nile flows from South to North
- top of a map is always north
- On a map, Egypt Delta, Lower Egypt, is located +above+ Upper Egypt.
- The topology of Africa is similar to an upside-down plate.
- Sahara desert and Libyan desert on either side of the Nile River Valley. 
- Egypt experience periodic predictable flooding. They knew when floods were coming and they could prepare for it, around 4200 BCE.
- The floods would leave Egypt with fabulous, rich, black, alluvial top soil. Easily workable soil.
- Mesopatia had a lot of clay in their soil. That's why they invented the plow. Egyptians would just disperse their seeds and send their cattle onto the soil. *Q2
- Ancient Egpyt had a dense population
- The Red Sea protected Egypt from invasion. Any people entering this region would enter it slowly over time. They became Egyptians. This is called gradual acculturalation 
- Egypt didn't face invasion during it's formative years.
- Egyptians had stone, Mesopatamia didn't. Mesopatamians used clay bricks. Clay bricks decay faster then stone does, that's why Egyptian pyramids are still here. *Q2*
- Egypt had papyrus that came from the swamp of the Delta of the Nile River. They turned this papyrus into writing surfaces, like paper.
- The Delta of the Nile River is a swamp. 
- In order to travel from Lower Egypt to Upper Egypt, Egyptians made boats out of bundles of reeds. eventually, Egyptians will use wooden boats.
- Mediterranean is North
- To travel south, you put up a sail
- Around 4000BCE, city states (small countries)
- Two periods of Egyptian history:
	- pre-dynastic and dynastic. dynastic means family rule


- 3100BCE Narmer unifies Upper and Lower Egypt together. Narmer is Egypt's first pharoah. He claims to be the son of the sun god: Ra.
- Unity of church and state. This will cause problems.
- Old Kingdom: 3100-2200BCE
- Middle Kingdom 2200BCE-1730BCE
- the Empire 1575-1100BCE

OLD KINGDOM
- Capital of Egypt is Memphis, near the Delta of the Nile. 
- Tremendous organization abilites
- Giza is where the pyramids were. The pyramids are on the west side of the Nile.
- Cats were and still are gods in Egypt.

- According to early Greek historian Herodotus, 100,000 Egyptians planned and constructed the Khufu pyramid over 20 years.
- Ancient Egypt was incredibly wealthy

+**MESOPOTAMIA**+
- Mesopotamia, modern day Iraq, has TWO rivers
	- Tigris to the north
	- Euphrates to the south
- Unlike Egypt's Nile, the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers of Mesopotamia flooded at various times. People couldn't prepare for floods. Floods were, therefore, very destructive to civilization here
- Egyptians believed the Gods favored them, the Mesopotamians believed the Gods were punishing them
- Mesopotamians had a pessimistic outlook on both life and afterlife. They didn't believe in an afterlife
- Unlike Egypt, Mesopotamia's geography couldn't keep out invaders. No real barrier to invaders. Mesopotamia was subject to lots of invasion throughout history.
	- Mesopotamia's topography: low flat-level plane with a hill. 
		- The hill is manmade from invaders constantly building upon the ruins of various civlizations in Mesopotamia.
- Due to constant invasion, Mesopotamian culture spreads
**The people of Summer**
- The people of summer arrive from the Indus River Valley- also known as geographic India, or the Indian subcontinent- in the modern-day country of Pakistan.
- Starting around 5000BCE, we see people immigration into southern Mesopotamia from the citizens of the advanced marchant civilization of the Indus River Valley. After 1000 years of this immigration, we see the political development of independent city-states around 4000BCE. After another 2000 years, independent city-states are more like small countries ("think Vatican city today"). They unify and become known as the Sumerian civilization. 
- The Sumerian civilization is intact for a mere 100 yeras before it is overthrown in 1900BCE.
**Back to general Mesopotamia**
- Mesopotamian had clay instead of stone or rock. 
	- Clay decays quicker than stone.
- Mesopotamians developed cuneiform writing, writing on clay tablets with a stylus- a three pointed reid.
- The civilizations of Mesopotamia were commercial, business civiliztions. They kept a tremendous amount of records.
- The use of base 12 in ancient Mesopotamia is responsible for modern use of base 12 (our time system, 360 degrees)
- developed the arch
- Step pyramids. Different type of pyramids than the ancient Egyptian pyramids.
- Sumerian law was retaliation in kind. 
- Sumerians developed a semi-private administration of justice.
	- The crime-doer is brought in front of a judge who determines guilt or innocence.
- Justice inequality: the higher up on the social scale you were, the harsher the punishment for the same crime
- Polytheistic religion, anthropomorphic gods
	- anthropomorphic means man-like
- Sumerians believed mankind was to serve God.
- They had a creation epic, a flood epic, the first man epic
- The Sumerians are going to be replaced by the Old Babylonians. The Babylonians came out of the Saudi Arabian desert. Entered Mesopotamia around 1900BCE. Their civilization lasts until 1650BCE.
**Old Babylonian contributions to civilization
- Stern justice: eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.
	- The U.S. also has a stern sense of justice.
- Division of classes. The higher up on the social scale you were, the harsher the punishment for the same crime.
- Fair treatment of women due to advanced business society
	- In a business civilization, the status of women is higher. In a warrior civilization, the status of women is lower.

- Zoro Aster, Persian philospher, created a DUALISTIC (2 gods) religious philosophy called Zoro-Asterism. We think he got the idea from ancient Egypt.
	- 1) a good god, the Sun god, the god of lightness and goodness
	- 2) a demon of darkness and evil, Mainyu 
	- these two beings are in constant conflict with each other.
